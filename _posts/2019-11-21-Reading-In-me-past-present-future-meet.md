To hold long chiding conference.

<!-- more -->

My lusts usurp the present tense

And strangle Reason in his seat.

My loves leap through the future's fence

To dance with dream-enfranchised feet.

In me the cave-man clasps the seer,

And garlanded Apollo goes

Chanting to Abraham's deaf ear.

In me the tiger sniffs the rose.

Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble,

Since there your elements assemble.
